# 1. What is Desmond?
Desmond is a Kotlin library to generate and verify check digits of multiple Brazilian services, such as bank account numbers.

# 2. How does it work?
The library works by generating a valid check digit based on official documentation on how they are generated.
The verification process first generates the digit based on the given information and compares with the check digit provided when calling the method.

# 3. How to use it?
Coming soon.
